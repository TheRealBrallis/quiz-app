# Quiz App

This is a simple quiz app built with React.

The quiz contains 5 questions where you are provided with 4 different answers on each question

## How it works

To start the app you can run:

### `npm start`

Once the app has started you will be greeted with a menu screen where you can start the quiz.

And from here on just press the answer you think is correct and proceed to the next question!
